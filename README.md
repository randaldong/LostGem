# LostGem

2D pixel sidescroller made with Unity



## Art Design

### Main Character

[Generic Character Asset v 0.2](https://brullov.itch.io/generic-char-asset)

15 Animations:

- [ ] Idle;

- [ ] Combo sword attack;
- [ ] Critical hit (attack);
- [ ] Running;
- [ ] Walking;

- [ ] Falling;
- [ ] Sliding;
- [ ] Wall sliding;
- [ ] Taking damage;
- [ ] Ladder climbing;
- [ ] Crouch;
- [ ] Shield defense;
- [ ] Spell cast;
- [ ] Death.



### Mobs

Using OOP:

- virtual function; override
- access modifiers

#### Boar



### Environment

[Legacy Fantasy](https://anokolisa.itch.io/sidescroller-pixelart-sprites-asset-pack-forest-16x16)



## Animator System

Transition condition: bool, trigger, value

### Idle

### Walk

Character: velocity value, decided by controller

Boar: `isWalk` bool --> idle, `isRun` bool --> walk; hit wall, wait for a few seconds, turn around, walk

### Run

Boar: if detects player/attacked by player

### Jump

### Crouch



### Take Damage

Could take damage from any state

Add a TAKE-DAMAGE FLASH effect in a new layer



## Stat System

### Health

- [ ] `maxHealth`
- [ ] `curHealth`
- [ ] `invincibleTime`

Take damage:

- after taking one damage, apply "Invincibility Frames" (using [Coroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Coroutines.html) vs. â€‹Async (implemented as [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)))
- apply animation for taking damage (may trigger lots of times in a short time, better to use a trigger instead of bool)
- get bounced back a little bit & disable movement (freeze for a while)
- can use `UnityEvent` for a series of events after taking damage



Death:

- after `curHealth == 0`, paly death animation (use bool), disable gameplay input control



### Attack

- [ ] `attackMode`: {Touch, Hit}

- click mouse left button to perform attack
- 3-hit combo attack (transit by trigger)
- apply attack (enemy falls into attack area)
- disable "attack while moving" (for there's no lower body animation for that) using `StateMachineBehaviour`



## Physics System

### Attack Area

### Wall

when hit wall:

- `curSpeed = 0`
- animation switch to `Idle`
- wait for a few seconds to turn around
- play `Walk` animation
- set back `curSpeed`
